# Unused to Reuse

Reuse is a platform that allows you to donate your old items to people who need them. Items which are set active are available for Reuse. Anyone near the location can pick up the item for free. Items which are set inactive were previously donated.

## Inspiration

We were inspired by the idea of sharing and helping others. We wanted to create a platform that would allow people to donate their old items to people who need them. We also wanted to create a platform that would allow people to reuse items that are no longer needed by others.

## What it does

Reuse is a platform that allows you to donate your old items to people who need them. Items which are set active are available for Reuse. Anyone near the location can pick up the item for free. Items which are set inactive were previously donated.

## How we built it

we Reuse built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB and Firebase. We used Next.js for the front end and back end. We used Tailwind CSS for styling. We used MongoDB for storing the data. We used Firebase for storing the images.

## Challenges we ran into

We ran into a lot of challenges. 
- Initially, we had some issues related to tailwind CSS but we were able to fix them.
- One of the major issues we faced was creating a static paths function for the dynamic routes.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

we are proud that we were able to create the minimum viable product in such a short time. we are also happy with the design of the website and functionality of the website.

## What we learned

We learned a lot about next.js and its routing concepts.


## What's next for Unused to Reuse
We are planning to add a few more features and deploy the website for public use. We are also planning to add a feature that would allow users to put a timer on the items they donate. This would enable users to set a time limit for the items they donate. After the time limit is over the items will be automatically set inactive.

## Built With
